# Typora Micro-Blog

![Screenshot](_documentation/screenshot-homepage.jpg)

## Overview
This software provides a website for hosting a microblog. I wanted a dead-simple blog: the ability to create posts with some bare-bones metadata, no comments, no interconnectivity, and no reliance on an external database. The styling and inspiration come from the [Night Theme](http://theme.typora.io/theme/Night/) for the [Typora Markdown Editor](https://typora.io/). As a result, it is optimized for integration with documents exported from Typora as HTML.

The CSS styling for the Typora Night theme (included in this repository) is available from the [Typora Theme Gallery](http://theme.typora.io). It was made by the theme creators, I claim no credit for it.
